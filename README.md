**Support**

Jina has a [slack](https://slack.jina.ai/) channel where every person from our team is very active in answering questions, resolving doubts and communicating. Please join the slack channel, introduce yourself and ask any questions that you might have.

**Project idea**

We maintain our documentation regularly and recently have developed our own free bootcamp on our [Learning Portal](https://learn.jina.ai/). Every newcomer in the community is made aware of neural search and they are directed to a free bootcamp on the[Learning portal](https://learn.jina.ai/) where they can learn new concepts, practice them with quizzes, win certificates and get ahead in their learning.

Recently, Jina migrated from v2.6 to v3.0 and it now allows support for integrations with different vector databases. Following these changes, a lot of new content was generated. And, we would like to take help of a technical writer who can restructure the Learning Portal for accommodating new content, add the updated content, make it more user friendly and help us in improving the way we spread information. The technical writer will be mentored by 3-4 core members of Jina.

The key aspect in learning Jina and neural search is our Learning Portal which we plan to update, restructure and overall, re-develop from scratch this year. This not only keeps our goal of open source educational content fulfilled but also helps provide our team useful insights for user experience.

**Project scope**

The following tasks are included in the project scope:

1. Improving the structure of the Learning Portal such that it is more user friendly and displays fresh and updated content.
2. A clear distinction of the topics and content between beginner, intermediate and advanced sections catering to the updates post Jina 3 release.
3. Tying together the different parts of a section better through a smooth transition of content flow.
4. Figuring out alternative ways to repurpose and better represent the content.
5. Update the learning portal to be a representative to the entire Jina ecosystem.
6. Feedback is an important part of improving the documentation. The scope of this project improves by running through the submissions of the first survey/feedback form and then improving on it. We have some feedback right now but we would like to run a more consolidated survey again for the learning portal.
7. Create an introductory blog post explaining the learning portal, the navigation, the benefits and next steps (post completing of bootcamp)
8. Sync the new documentation set with the code to support continuous integration with code changes. Since Jina changes and the functions do too, it is only beneficial to make the upgradation process automatic.

**Skills required**

1. Technical documentation
2. Python experience
3. Github experience
4. Communication skills
5. Ability to understand user experience and interest in improving the user experience
6. AI/ML background is a plus but not required.

**Writing the proposal**

Your proposal should contain the following information. Any other information that you wish to add is optional. Please make sure your proposal contains everything we might need to know about your experience and skills so that we can make an informed decision.

1. Personal details
2. Professional details and experience
3. Motivation to apply
4. Project plan and implementation strategy (be as specific as possible, listing down everything you wish to do)
5. Other commitments
6. Communication details and preferred mode of communication
7. Proposed budget (for the entire project)

**What makes a strong proposal?**

For having a strong proposal, we believe that:

1. The proposal should lay out clear milestones that divide your project into different small parts. These milestones can be weekly, monthly or bi-weekly.
2. The proposal should clearly explain the motivation behind your application and also justify how your skills match the requirements.
3. The proposal has milestones which are measurable.
4. The proposal also has clear, unambiguous goals and objectives.
5. Lastly, the proposal in itself should depict the writer&#39;s ability to complete the project successfully and also depict that the applicant indeed understands the problem they will be tackling and accordingly can come up with the solution.

**How to apply**

- Please send your proposals in a PDF format to [jyoti.bisht@jina.ai](mailto:jyoti.bisht@jina.ai) with the subject &quot;GSoD 2022 proposal&quot; before the deadline.
